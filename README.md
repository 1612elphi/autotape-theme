# autotape-theme
A glowing retro-futurist terminal inspired theme for Obsidian

**Autotape** is a minimal Obsidian theme designed to invoke the feeling of old-style terminal interfaces without looking dated. Designed for Dark Mode, but compatible with either.

Autotape is fully compatible with the accent colour system. Simply select the colour you'd like in the Appearance section of Obsidian options and watch the theme change!
